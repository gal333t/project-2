# Project Two

## Mother's Day flask app database crossover

## What was the assignment?

The assignment was to incorporate Python, Flask and SQL databases to create a functioning website. Given the timing of when this project was due, I decided to use the opportunity to base my project around Mother's Day.

## What does the website show?

There are 2 main features of the website, but it depends on who has logged in. Anyone is welcome to create a new user and login! But there are 2 special log ins that have slightly different views. We'll come back to users, let's focus on features first.
\
\
The first feature is Messages. Here, a normal user (aka one of my mother's children), can write a new message, edit an old one, or even delete it. It also displays all the messages written by the logged in user on the page. You can't see what anyone else has done, and only have control of your own.
\
\
The second feature is Images. There's an option to search by year, and a random photo with a short description will appear. 
\
\
Now if you were logged in as me, Galit, you could also go and add a new image to the database that everyone can see in a search. There's also a way to edit & delete photos in the database as Galit as well. And if you're lucky enough to be logged in as my mother, then you'd get an extra option to not just search by year, but to see all photos at once.
\
\
Logged in as my mother, you also don't get to add/edit/delete messages but instead you get to see all messages added and by who. I probably should also add a search for my mum to see just her favourite child's messages and exclude the rest of ours. We all know who the favourite is and it's not me!
\
\
My mum is still playing with my first project, Word Galactica, so I hope this one is a winner as well!

## What more do I want to do with this project?

- I'd love to style it better, I quite like CSS but then I blank on how it should look. Maybe incorporate flex for the see all image option.

- More search options, but in a not so clunky looking way.. Once the CSS improves, I think this will be an easy addition to make.
